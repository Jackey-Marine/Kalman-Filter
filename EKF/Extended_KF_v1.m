%
% Version 1.0
%
% Syntax:
%     [Xo,Po] = Extended_KF(f,g,Q,R,Z,X,P,Xstate)
%
% State Equation:
%     X(n+1) = f(X(n)) + w(n)
% Observation Equation:
%     Z(n) = g(X(n)) + v(n)
%     w ~ N(0,Q) is gaussian noise with covariance Q
%     v ~ N(0,R) is gaussian noise with covariance R     
% Input:
%     f: function for state transition, type of symbolic expression 
%     g: function for measurement, type of symbolic expression
%     Q: process noise covariance
%     R: measurement noise covariance
%     
%     Z: current measurement
%     
%     X: "a priori" state estimate
%     P: "a priori" estimated state covariance
%
%     Xstate: symbols of state vector
% Output:
%     Xo: "a posteriori" state estimate
%     Po: "a posteriori" estimated state covariance

% Algorithm for Extended Kalman Filter:
% Linearize input functions f and g to get fy(state transition matrix)
% and H(observation matrix) for an ordinary Kalman Filter
% 1. Xp = f(X)                      : One step projection, also provides 
%                                     linearization point
% 
% 2. 
%          d f    |
% fy = -----------|                 : Linearize state equation, fy is the
%       d Xstate  |X=Xp               Jacobian of the process model
%       
% 
% 3.
%          d g    |
% H  = -----------|                 : Linearize observation equation, H is
%       d Xstate  |X=Xp               the Jacobian of the measurement model
%             
%       
% 4. Pp = fy * P * fy' + Q          : Covariance of Xp
% 
% 5. K = Pp * H' * inv(H * Pp * H' + R): Kalman Gain
% 
% 6. Xo = Xp + K * (Z - g(Xp))      : Output state
% 
% 7. Po = [I - K * H] * Pp          : Covariance of Xo

% Example:
% Kalman filter for GPS positioning
% The following is a brief illustration of the principles of GPS. For more
% information see reference [2].
% The Global Positioning System(GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system
% that provides a user with proper equipment access to positioning
% information. The most commonly used approaches for GPS positioning are
% the Iterative Least Square(ILS) and the Kalman filtering(KF) methods. 
% Both of them is based on the pseudorange equation:
%                rho = || Xs - X || + b + v
% in which Xs and X represent the position of the satellite and
% receiver, respectively, and || Xs - X || represents the distance between 
% them. b represents the clock bias of receiver, and it need to be solved 
% along with the position of receiver. rho is a measurement given by 
% receiver for each satellites, and v is the pseudorange measurement noise 
% modeled as white noise.
% There are 4 unknowns: the coordinate of receiver position and the clock
% bias. The ILS is largely used to calculate these unknowns and is
% implemented in this example as a comparison. In the KF solution we use
% the Extended Kalman filter(EKF) to deal with the nonlinearity of the
% pseudorange equation, and a CV model(constant velocity) as the process
% model.

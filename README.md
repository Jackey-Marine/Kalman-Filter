# Kalman-Filter

Kalman Filter and Extend Kalman Filter code records.

Two existing work results are referenced.

# Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python

The book and supporting software can be downloaded from GitHub by running this command on  the command line:

```
cd Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python
git clone https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python.git
pip install filterpy
```

If you do not have pip, you may follow the instructions [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).

Instructions for installation of the IPython ecosystem can be found in the Installation appendix, found [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/Appendix-A-Installation.ipynb).

Once the software is installed you can navigate to the installation directory and run Jupyter notebook with the command line instruction

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a browser window showing the contents of the base directory. The book is organized into chapters, each contained within one IPython Notebook (these notebook files have a .ipynb file extension).

## Filterpy

An open source Bayesian filtering Python library called  **FilterPy**. To install from PyPi, at the command line issue the command:

```
pip install filterpy
```

**FilterPy** is hosted on github at [FilterPy](https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy).

## Alternative Way of Running the Book in Conda environment

If you have conda or miniconda installed, you can create an environment by

```
conda create --name your_env_name python=3.X
```

Finding your Conda environment

```
conda info --envs
conda env list
```

and use

```
conda activate your_env_name
```

exit

```
conda deactivate
```

to activate and deactivate the environment.
